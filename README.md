# 🎮 Play-All-ToyText with Q-Learning

Welcome to the **Play-All-ToyText with Q-Learning** project! 🚀  
In this project, I've applied the Q-Learning algorithm to solve problems in popular ToyText environments like FrozenLake, CliffWalking, Blackjack, and Taxi-v3.

The goal is to train agents using Q-Learning to optimize policies and maximize rewards in these environments.

## 🔍 Introduction

In ToyText environments, agents learn to take actions by maximizing rewards in games such as:

- **FrozenLake** 🌊  
- **CliffWalking** 🧗‍♂️  
- **BlackJack** 🃏  
- **Taxi** 🚕  

The objective of this project is to apply the **Q-Learning** algorithm to optimize agents' policies and achieve the highest possible rewards.
